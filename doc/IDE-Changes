2013-10-15  Rudolf Hornig

    Fixed the launcher not to throw error if the toolchain is clang.

2013-10-14  Rudolf Hornig

    Now using Eclipse 4.3.1 as base for the IDE

2013-09-13  Tamas Borbely

	Implemented project specific image searches. The "image" folder of the
	project and its dependency projects are added to the image path. New image
	path is automatically used by the NED editor and other places where module
	are displayed. (Folder name is hardcoded now; this will be configurable
	in future releases).

    Additional changes:
    - Launch dialog contains a field to specify the --tkenv-image-path option;
      by default its value is populated with the image path of the project
      containing the working directory.
    - Added ${opp_image_path:dir} variable substitution.
    - Caches are invalidated if OMNETPP_IMAGE_PATH, the project dependencies, or
      the image directories or files have changed.

    Also: NED palette scales images to 16x16 and 24x24. Previously the aspect
    ratio was kept.

    Scave: name of 'substract' filter changed to 'subtract' (typo)

2013-09-30  Levente Meszaros

    Sequence Chart: Fixed error handling when the error occurs in paint during
    startup.

2013-09-12  ------ omnetpp-4.3.1 released ------

2013-09-12  Levente Meszaros, Andras Varga

	When the IDE is started with an empty workspace (e.g. on first-time
	launch), a dialog comes up automatically that offers the user the
	following options for getting something into the workspace:

	- Import the OMNeT++ sample simulations into the workspace
	- Download and install INET Framework

	The latter function is also available now via the Help > Install
	Simulation Models... menu item. The menu item brings up a dialog
	with the list of simulation models available for automated installation,
	and lets the user choose. Currently only the INET Framework is
	listed there, but it is planned to add further models.

2013-09-12  Levente Meszaros, Andras Varga

	When the IDE was started for the first time, the user formerly saw an
	empty workbench window (apart from the imported samples). Now some
	helpful introductory pages are displayed in the editor area:

	- "Getting Started" - practical advice for getting past the first
	  10 minutes spent in the IDE

	- "At a Glance" - explains the common file types (NED, msg, ini) and
	  their purposes

	- "The Simulation Examples" - explains each example simulation in two
	  sentences, then provides links for opening the project, viewing the
	  README, launching the simulation, etc.

	These pages are also available in the Help system (except the last one,
	which has a dedicated menu item under the Help menu.)

2013-09-06  Andras Varga

	Run dialog > OMNeT++ Simulation > Launch tab: bug fixes:
	- pasting "a}" into the Working dir field caused weird behavior
	- pasting ${ into workingDir caused error dialog

2013-08-28  Andras Varga

	IDE: import sample projects even if workspace is different from omnetpp/samples

2012-12-17  Rudolf Hornig

	Debugging: the default gdbinit file is now ${opp_root}/misc/gdb/gdbinit.py
	when a new launch configuration is created.

	Also added support for project-specific gdbinit files: the .gdbinit.py
	script in the project root is now automatically sourced by the default
	init script. Project-specific gdbinit files can be used to initialize
	pretty printers specific to the project.

2011-11-15  Rudolf Hornig

	Launcher: for the running program, the configuration name is now
	correctly displayed in the Console view.

2012-12-11  Rudolf Hornig

	Debugging: switched over to the newer DSF debugger framework of CDT.

2012-11-30  Rudolf Hornig, Andras Varga

	IDE: Added support for opening files from the command line, i.e. the command

	  $ omnetpp Aloha.ned Aloha.cc

	will work as expected (opens these files on startup). If necessary,
	the IDE will open the containing projects if they are closed, and will
	even offer creating/importing a project if the files are outside all
	workspace projects.

2012-11-21  Levente Meszaros

	EventLog, Sequence Chart: better error reporting

2012-11-13  Rudolf Hornig

	CDT: disabled Code Analysis by default. It displayed tons of bogus
	"Semantic Errors" that totally confused novice users.

2012-11-06  Rudolf Hornig

	Command line: the build output is now less verbose (for gcc/mingw).
	Only the file names are printed when building, not whole command lines.

2012-10-24  Rudolf Hornig

	Productizing: updated to Eclipse 3.8.1, removed our own linuxtools
	feature, changed to Cocoa framework from Carbon on OS X, moved to Java
	1.6 as a minimum requirement.

2012-10-16  Levente Meszaros

	Common: avoid showing a hover while any mouse button is pressed

2012-10-15  Tamas Borbely

	Launcher: dialog main page: cosmetics on labels

2012-10-09  Levente Meszaros, Andras Varga

	IDE: use StyledText instead of Browser for HTML hover information

	Motivation: The Browser widget is not always available on all platforms
	(constant xulrunner problems on Linux, etc).

2012-10-09  Levente Meszaros

	IDE: added Full Screen menu item, bound to Ctrl+Shift+F11

2012-07-17  Tamas Borbely

	IDE: fix: change remaining KB/MB to KiB/MiB

2012-03-13  Rudolf Hornig

	Scave: removed export support for Matlab script output.
	The generated script was syntactically incorrect, plus Matlab uses only
	the first 63 chars as identifiers, and this causes collisions between names.

	CSV should be used as data export for Matlab.

2012-03-12  Rudolf Hornig

	CDT: fix #532: Makemake and Project Features pages are now displayed
	only if the project is both OMNeT++ and CDT project

	* Before running a simulation, the IDE will show the command line in
	 the console view to help you execute the same simulation from the
	 command line.

	* CTRL-TAB now works on freshly opened NED files even if you do not explicitly
	 select a simple module. In this case the IDE opens the .h and .cc files
	 associated with the first simple module in the NED file.

2011-05-05  ------ omnetpp-4.2b2 released ------

2011-05-03 Levente Meszaros

	around 10.000 submodules.

	* Performance: NED validation is done now in a background thread

2011-02-03 Rudolf Hornig

	* Graphical editor: Figure borders and outlines now correctly follow the zoom level.

	* Graphical editor: The resize/move feedback figures have been changed to transparent blue from a simple outline.

2011-02-03 Levente Meszaros

	* Added Technology Preview version of the network animator. It works only on .elog files
	smaller than 10Mb. You can open it by right clicking on an .elog file and selection "Open with...".
	This implementation is NOT optimized for larger files.

2011-02-01 Rudolf Hornig

	* NED Files are refreshed now before opening. No more "file is out of sync" message if the opened
	NED file was modified outside of the IDE.

2011-02-01 Andras Varga

	* Simulation launcher: Size of the popup information tooltip is limited when displaying all the runs.
	(i.e. whan the parameter space is too big)

2011-01-31 Levente Meszaros

	* Added the possibility to go to a specific simulation time in event log view by specifying
	relative values (+-) in the dialog (units are supported)

	* In sequence chart added 'Goto simulation time' and 'Goto event number' in the context menu

	* Sequence chart: the current position is shown in the gutter

	* Completion proposals in inner types after @ are working properly in ned text editor

2011-01-28 Andras Varga

2011-01-24 Rudolf Hornig

	* Context menu in graphical editor is reorganized for better and easier access of the
	 most used functions.

	* Linux tools now included in the build. It allows to profile the simulation using Valgrind
	on Linux systems. (Windows and Mac builds does not have this capability). Use the "Profile as"
	menu item in the context menu of the project directory.

2011-01-21 Rudolf Hornig

	* Go to C++ definiton (CTRL-TAB) now correctly finds the appropriate C++ class even if the
	NED type is extending another type or it is using the @class property. (bug #238)

2011-01-20 Rudolf Hornig

	* In graphical editor the previous action used with double click (go to type or supertype)
	has ben moved to the F3 key. It is also available from the context menu.

2011-01-20 Andras Varga

	* Added a brand new Property dialog that can be accessed by double clicking on the module or type.
	Type, name, vector size and graphical properties are supported. A preview is shown at the bottom
	of the dialog.

	* Enhanced Ned Type Selection dialog (CTRL-SHIFT-N)

2011-01-18 Rudolf Hornig

	* The package name for the ned file is shown at the top in the graphical editor

	* Validator used for entering type names (in the Property View) now correctly
	supports inner types and packages

2011-01-07 Rudolf Hornig

	* NED Editor now supports drag-and-drop operations of inner types (moving
	an inner type to top level, or the other way around). Types dropped inside
	the submodule area create a submodule with that type. Types dropped on the
	title area of the compound module create an inner type.

2011-01-06 Andras Varga

	* Unit name now can be set in property editor for compound modules

2011-01-04 Andras Varga

	* Compound module border now can be set to 0 width

2011-01-04 Rudolf Hornig

	* In the graphical editor, inner types can now be created by dropping
	a NED type on the title of the compound module

2011-01-03 Rudolf Hornig

	* The simulation process is now started by using relative paths. The
	command line displayed in the console when the process start has
	failed is much more readable now.

2010-12-22 Rudolf Hornig

	* Property cell editors for type, liketype, extends properties on simple
	modules, compound modules, channels, submodules and connections are now
	displaying all the possible types correctly. Cells contents are validated
	so nonexistent types cannot be used.

2010-12-17 Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed #230. The values for Type, Like and Extends property on a submodule/connections/or
	NED type (top-level or inner) are initialized correctly. They contain correct values according
	to the current lookup context.

	* Cloning or creating new inner types using the graphical editor now generates unique names correctly

2010-12-16 Rudolf Hornig

	* Changed the palette entry ordering in NED editor to include inner types in the current file on the top.

2010-12-15 Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed #229. In NED Editor: Inherited display property values can be cleared now using "-" as a value.
	It is possible now to remove an icon even if the ancestor specified one.

2010-12-14 Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed the tooltip of the "Display property" in the properties view. No longer displays null[0]

2010-12-13 Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed bug#224. NPEs when cloning submodules with connections which are defined in an ancestor module.
	* Fixed bug#227. NPE on upinning a submodule

2010-12-11 Rudolf Hornig

	* Added plugin customization to force workspace refresh on IDE startup.

2010-12-11 Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed bug#213. NPE occurred in NedEditorLauncher if the filesystem and the workspace got out of sync.

2010-12-11 Andras Varga

	* IDE: fix of bug #145: Open NED Type dialog comes up empty on first invocation
	NedTypeSelectionDialog now contains a INedChangeListener, and any NED
	change triggers a delayed update of the displayed list.

	* IDE: fix for bug #223: bogus "X seems to be a hand-written makefile" message
	when the makefile was deleted from the disk behind the IDE's back

2010-12-10 Rudolf Hornig

	* Changed the default OMNeT++ source code formatter profile to match the current INET coding convention.
	Profile is using only spaces instead of tabs for indentation.

2010-12-10 Andras Varga

	* IDE: fix for bug #222: Chinese comments become gibberish in NED files.
	Solution: wherever possible, save files in the file's own encoding
	(i.e. charset), using content.getBytes(ifile.getCharset()).

2010-12-06 Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: Added a "Clean Selected Projects" menuitem to the project explorer context menu.
	This item DOES NOT clean referred projects.

2010-11-10 Rudolf Hornig

	* Support for Profiling (in addition to Debug and Run modes). (enable to use linuxtools with valgrind)

2010-10-19 Rudolf Hornig

	* MachO64 parser support added for new CDT projects. Updated error parsers provided by CDT 7.x.

2010-09-30 Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated the base system to Eclipse 3.6.1

2010-09-22 Andras Varga

	* IDE: fixed resolution of parametric submodule types in NedTreeTraversal

	* IDE: refined the resolution of parametric submodule types
	The actual type needs to be resolved in the project of the inifile,
	not in the project of the compound module that contains the submodule
	(for example, udpApp's type need not be in StandardHost's project INET,
	it may also come from a project that has INET as dependency)

2010-07-13 Tamas Borbely

	* Scave: Line type on vector chart did get reflected in the Chart Properties dialog (issue 182).
	When the line property has the same value for each selected line in the Properties dialog,
	then that value is displayed in the control, instead of 'No change'.

	* Scave: Empty chart if refreshing a temp chart after re-running simulation (issue 186).
	When creating a temp chart, runs was identified by runname, now they are identified
	by file/configname/runnumber. 'Add Selected Data to Dataset' and 'Convert to Dataset'
	actions also use the file/configname/runnumber fields for consistency.

2010-07-19 Levente Meszaros

	* SeqChart: Fixed a NPE.

	* SeqChart: fix handling show/hide [self] message reuses toggle buttons
	There was some confusion between those buttons, now they toggle showing/hidign
	only for those arrows that they represent.

	* SeqChart: fix message reuse arrows when affected by a module method call
	The end point for a message reuse was wrong. It used the event's module of
	the begin send entry instead of the context module to determine the Y coordinate.

2010-07-13 Tamas Borbely

	* fix issue 180: fixed assert when double coordinate is +-Infinite

	* fix issue 196: use file/configname/runnumber to identify runs of temp chart data

2010-07-13 Tamas Borbely

	* BaseLineChartEditForm: fix issue 182
	When the line property has the same value for each selected line,
	then that value is displayed in the control instead of 'No change'.

2010-07-12 Tamas Borbely

	* small layout fix in BaseLineChartEditForm

2010-07-08 Andras Varga

	* Scave: fix focus problems (bug #188) by using the new FocusManager class

2010-07-07 Andras Varga

	* Scave: drawing timeouts come now from preferences

	* Scave: time limit facility for line chart plotting

	* Scave: removed smartMode in LinePlot as it was responsible for bug #181
	Turning off symbols for DOTS line type resulted in empty chart.
	http://dev.omnetpp.org/bugs/view.php?id=181

	* SeqChart: axis ordering dialog layout improved: buttons move to the right

	* SeqChart: fix: "Show self-messages" button (blue arched arrow) also toggled
	self-reuse (green) arrows on the chart

2010-06-23 Levente Meszaros

	* Sequence Chart: Fix for find text bug. Find text did not work in filtered eventlogs.

	* Cleanup the show/hide flags related to message send/reuse arrows.
	A couple of renames and minor tweaks, namely arrows are categorized along
	two axes: reuse/send, self/other.

2010-06-22 Andras Varga

	* Scave: fix unreadable (black-on-black) filter combo dropdown on ubuntu 10.04
	in Ubuntu 10.04: in the default theme, combo editfield is black-on-white
	and dropdown list is white-on-black, so calling setForeground() on the combo
	will inevitably make one of them unreadable. Workaround: do NOT call
	getForeground().

2009-08-03  Levente Meszaros

	* Connection chooser brings up channel chooser when using the default connection tool and there are matching labels between the connected gates and an available channel type.
	* Palette shows NED types in two distinct groups: the first contains those which are related to the current editor ordered by score, the second contains all available types ordered by name

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	* Text editor provides new context menu items to infer/distribute gate labels.

2009-07-15  Levente Meszaros

	* Palette provides regexp based substring filtering for qualified NED type names and @label properties.
	* Palette sorts submodules based on what is actually already used, what could be connected and @contains properties.

2009-07-14  Levente Meszaros

	* Added support for matching @labels properties of gates in the connection chooser popup menu.

2009-07-13  Levente Meszaros

	* Added validation to parameters dialog, reserved NED words cannot be parameter names, and parameter values must be valid expressions.

2009-06-09  Levente Meszaros

	* SEQCHART: Added sequence chart support to display module method calls as vertical orange arrows.
	The arrow's label is the method's name, tooltips are also available.

	* Some message send arrows were drawn incorrectly from the caller module due to not taking
	into consideration module method calls. From now on these kind of arrows might start from
	any point on a module's axis, even if there was no event at that simulation time in the
	callee module.

	* Store various show/hide flags in sequence chart eventlog configuration files.

2009-03-12  ------ omnetpp-4.0 released ------
