                THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE


The Win32 binary distribution of OMNeT++/OMNEST contains several open
source components which are covered by their own licenses. These components
are listed below, together with their web sites where you can find more
information and the source code.

We'd like to thank the open source community for developing and making
these packages available. OMNeT++/OMNEST would not have been possible
without them.


Eclipse

The OMNeT++/OMNEST IDE is based on the Eclipse Platform and additional
platform features and plug-ins, distributed under the EPL (Eclipse Public
License). http://www.eclipse.org.

Tcl/Tk

The Tkenv simulation execution environment is based on Tcl/Tk, an open-source
script language and GUI toolkit, written by James Ousterhout and many others.
Tcl/Tk is currently available from http://tcltk.sourceforge.net, under a
BSD-like license.

BLT

BLT is an extension to the Tk toolkit, adding new widgets and miscellaneous
commands. It does not require any patching of the Tcl or Tk source files.
OMNeT++/OMNEST uses BLT mainly for its table (multi-column
listbox) and tabbed notebook widgets. BLT is available from
http://blt.sourceforge.net, and it is distributed under a BSD-like license.

LibXML2

LibXML2 is an open-source XML parser, written by Daniel Veillard for the GNOME
project. The source is available from http://www.xmlsoft.org. OMNeT++/OMNEST
is bundled with Win32 binaries maintained by Igor Zlatkovic, and currently
available from http://www.zlatkovic.com. LibXML and ICONV (also a needed
component) are distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
