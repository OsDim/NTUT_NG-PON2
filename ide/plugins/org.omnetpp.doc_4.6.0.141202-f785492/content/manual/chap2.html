<h2><a name="sec104"/>2.1 Modeling Concepts</h2>

<p>An OMNeT++ model consists of modules that communicate with message passing.
The active modules are termed <i>simple modules</i>; they are written in C++,
using the simulation class library. Simple modules can be grouped into
<i>compound modules</i> and so forth; the number of hierarchy levels is
unlimited. The whole model, called network in OMNeT++, is itself a compound module.
Messages can be sent either via connections that span
modules or directly to other modules. The concept of simple and
compound modules is similar to DEVS atomic and coupled models.

<p>In Fig. <a href="chap2.html#fig:ch-overview:modules">below</a>, boxes represent simple modules
(gray background) and compound modules.
Arrows connecting small boxes represent connections and gates.

<p>

<p>Modules communicate with messages that may contain arbitrary
data, in addition to usual attributes such as a timestamp.
Simple modules typically send messages via gates, but it is also
possible to send them directly to their destination modules. Gates are the
input and output interfaces of modules: messages are sent through
output gates and arrive through input gates. An input gate and output gate
can be linked by a connection. Connections are created within a single
level of module hierarchy; within a compound module, corresponding gates of
two submodules, or a gate of one submodule and a gate of the compound
module can be connected. Connections spanning hierarchy levels are
not permitted, as they would hinder model reuse. Because of the hierarchical
structure of the model, messages typically travel through a chain of
connections, starting and arriving in simple modules. Compound modules act like
"cardboard boxes" in the model, transparently relaying messages between
their inner realm and the outside world. Parameters such as propagation delay,
data rate and bit error rate, can be assigned to connections. One can also
define connection types with specific properties (termed channels) and
reuse them in several places. Modules can have parameters. Parameters are
used mainly to pass configuration data to simple modules, and to help
define model topology. Parameters can take string, numeric, or boolean
values. Because parameters are represented as objects in the program,
parameters -- in addition to holding constants -- may transparently act as
sources of random numbers, with the actual distributions provided with the
model configuration. They may interactively prompt the user for the value,
and they might also hold expressions referencing other parameters. Compound
modules may pass parameters or expressions of parameters to their
submodules.

<p>
OMNeT++ provides efficient tools for the user to describe the
structure of the actual system. Some of the main features are the following:
<ul>
<li>hierarchically nested modules
<li>modules are instances of module types
<li>modules communicate with messages through channels
<li>flexible module parameters
<li>topology description language
</ul>

<p><h3><a name="sec105"/>2.1.1 Hierarchical Modules</h3>

<p>
An OMNeT++ model consists of hierarchically nested
modules<!--module!hierarchy--> that communicate by passing
messages to each other.
OMNeT++ models are often referred to as <i>networks</i>. The top
level module is the <i>system module</i>.  The system module
contains <i>submodules</i> that can also contain submodules
themselves (Fig. <a href="chap2.html#fig:ch-overview:modules">below</a>). The depth of module
nesting is unlimited, allowing the user to reflect the logical
structure of the actual system in the model structure.

<p>Model structure is described in OMNeT++'s NED language.

<p>Modules that contain submodules are termed <i>compound
  modules</i><!--module!compound-->, as opposed to <i>simple
  modules</i><!--module!simple--> at the lowest level of the
module hierarchy. Simple modules contain the algorithms of the model.
The user implements the simple modules in C++, using the OMNeT++
simulation class library.

<p>
<h3><a name="sec106"/>2.1.2 Module Types</h3>
<!--module!types-->

<p>Both simple and compound modules are instances of <i>module
  types</i>. In describing the model, the user defines module types;
instances of these module types serve as components for more complex
module types. Finally, the user creates the system module as an
instance of a previously defined module type; all modules of the
network are instantiated as submodules and sub-submodules of the
system module.

<p>When a module type is used as a building block, it makes no difference
whether it is a simple or compound module. This allows
the user to split a simple module into several
simple modules embedded into a compound<!--module!compound--> module,
or vice versa, to aggregate the functionality of a compound module into a
single simple module, without affecting existing users of the module
type.

<p>Module types can be stored in files separately from the place
of their actual usage. This means that the user can group existing
module types and create <i>component libraries</i><!--module!libraries-->. This feature
will be discussed later, in chapter <a href="chap10.html#sec355">[10]</a>.

<p>

<p><h3><a name="sec107"/>2.1.3 Messages, Gates, Links</h3>

<p>Modules communicate by exchanging
<i>messages</i><!--message!exchanging-->. In an actual simulation,
messages can represent frames or packets in a computer network, jobs
or customers in a queuing network or other types of mobile entities.
Messages can contain arbitrarily complex data structures. Simple
modules can send messages either directly to their destination or
along a predefined path, through gates and connections.

<p>
The &#8220;local simulation time&#8221; of a module advances when the module
receives a message. The message can arrive from another module
or from the same module (<i>self-messages</i> are used to implement
timers).

<p>
<i>Gates</i><!--gate--> are the input and output interfaces of
modules; messages are sent out through output gates and arrive through
input gates.

<p>Each <i>connection</i><!--connection--> (also called
<i>link</i><!--link-->) is created within a single level of the
module hierarchy: within a compound module, one can connect the
corresponding gates of two submodules, or a gate of one submodule and
a gate of the compound module (Fig.
<a href="chap2.html#fig:ch-overview:modules">below</a>).

<p>Because of the hierarchical structure of the model, messages typically
travel through a series of connections, starting and arriving in simple
modules. Compound modules act like &#8220;cardboard boxes&#8221; in the model,
transparently relaying messages between their inner realm and the
outside world.

<p>
<h3><a name="sec108"/>2.1.4 Modeling of Packet Transmissions</h3>

<p>To facilitate the modeling of communication networks, connections
can be used to model physical links. Connections support
the following parameters: <i>data rate</i>, <i>propagation delay</i>,
<i>bit error rate</i> and <i>packet error rate</i>, and may be
disabled. These parameters and the underlying algorithms are encapsulated
into <i>channel</i> objects. The user can parameterize the channel
types provided by OMNeT++, and also create new ones.

<p>When data rates are in use, a packet object is by default delivered to the
target module at the simulation time that corresponds to the end of the
packet reception. Since this behavior is not suitable for the modeling of
some protocols (e.g. half-duplex Ethernet), OMNeT++ provides the possibility
for the target module to specify that it wants the packet object to be
delivered to it when the packet reception starts.

<p>
<h3><a name="sec109"/>2.1.5 Parameters</h3>
<!--module!parameters-->
<!--parameters|seemodule parameters-->

<p>Modules can have parameters. Parameters can be assigned  in either
the NED files or the configuration file <tt>omnetpp.ini</tt>.

<p>Parameters can be used to customize simple module behavior,
and to parameterize the model topology.

<p>Parameters can take string, numeric or boolean values, or can
contain XML data trees. Numeric values include expressions using
other parameters and calling C functions, random variables from
different distributions, and values input interactively by the user.

<p>Numeric-valued parameters can be used to construct topologies in a
flexible way. Within a compound module, parameters can define the
number of submodules, number of gates, and the way the internal
connections are made.

<p>
<h3><a name="sec110"/>2.1.6 Topology Description Method</h3>
<!--topology!description-->

<p>The user defines the structure of the model in NED language descriptions
(Network Description). The NED language will be discussed in detail
in chapter <a href="chap3.html#sec115">[3]</a>.

<p>
<h2><a name="sec111"/>2.2 Programming the Algorithms</h2>

<p>The simple<!--module!simple--> modules of a model contain algorithms
as C++ functions.
The full flexibility and power of the programming language can
be used, supported by the OMNeT++ simulation class library.
The simulation programmer can choose between event-driven and process-style
description, and freely use object-oriented concepts
(inheritance, polymorphism etc) and design patterns to extend the
functionality of the simulator.

<p>Simulation objects (messages, modules, queues etc.) are represented
by C++ classes. They have been designed to work together efficiently,
creating a powerful simulation programming framework.
The following classes are part of the simulation class library:

<p><ul>
  <li>module, gate, parameter, channel
  <li>message, packet
  <li>container classes (e.g. queue, array)
  <li>data collection classes
  <li>statistic and distribution estimation classes (histograms, <i>P<sup>2</sup></i>
  algorithm for calculating quantiles etc.)
  <li>transient detection and result accuracy detection classes
</ul>

<p>The classes are also specially instrumented, allowing one
to traverse objects of a running simulation and display information
about them such as name, class name, state variables or contents.
This feature makes it possible to create a simulation GUI where
all internals of the simulation are visible.

<p>


<p><h2><a name="sec112"/>2.3 Using OMNeT++</h2>

<p>
<h3><a name="sec113"/>2.3.1 Building and Running Simulations</h3>
<!--simulation!building-->
<!--simulation!running-->

<p>This section provides insights into working with OMNeT++ in practice.
Issues such as model files and compiling and running simulations are
discussed.

<p>An OMNeT++ model consists of the following parts:
<ul>
  <li>NED language topology description(s)<!--ned!files--> (<tt>.ned</tt> files)
    that describe the module structure with parameters, gates, etc.
    NED files can be written using any text editor, but the OMNeT++ IDE
    provides excellent support for two-way graphical and text editing.
  <li>Message definitions (<tt>.msg</tt> files). You can define various message
    types and add data fields to them. OMNeT++ will translate message definitions
    into full-fledged C++ classes.
  <li>Simple module sources. They are C++ files, with <tt>.h</tt>/<tt>.cc</tt> suffix.
</ul>

<p>The simulation system provides the following components:
<ul>
  <li>Simulation kernel<!--simulation!kernel-->. This contains the
    code that manages the simulation and the simulation class library.
    It is written in C++, compiled into a shared or static library.
  <li>User interfaces<!--simulation!user interface-->.
    <!--user interface--> OMNeT++ user interfaces
    are used in simulation execution, to facilitate debugging,
    demonstration, or batch execution of simulations. They are
    written in C++, compiled into libraries.
</ul>

<p>
Simulation programs are built from the above components. First,
<tt>.msg</tt> files are translated into C++ code using the <tt>opp_msgc</tt>.
program. Then all C++ sources are compiled and linked with the simulation
kernel and a user interface library to form a simulation executable or
shared library. NED files<!--ned!files--> are loaded dynamically in their original
text forms when the simulation program starts.

<p>
<p class="subheading">Running the Simulation and Analyzing the Results</p>

<p>The simulation may be compiled as a standalone program executable;
thus it can be run on other machines without OMNeT++
being present, or it can be created as a shared library. In this case the
OMNeT++ shared libraries must be present on that system.
When the program is started, it first reads all NED files<!--ned!files-->
containing your model topology, then it reads a configuration
file<!--simulation!configuration file--> (usually called
<tt>omnetpp.ini</tt><!--omnetpp.ini-->). This file contains settings that
control how the simulation is executed, values for model parameters, etc.
The configuration file can also prescribe several simulation runs; in
the simplest case, they will be executed by the simulation program one
after another.

<p>The output of the simulation is written into result files: output vector
files<!--output!vector file-->, output scalar files<!--output!scalar file-->,
and possibly the user's own output files.
OMNeT++ contains an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides
rich environment for analyzing these files. Output files are line-oriented
text files which makes it possible to process them with a variety of tools
and programming languages as well, including Matlab, GNU R, Perl, Python,
and spreadsheet programs.

<p>
<p class="subheading">User Interfaces</p>
<!--simulation!user interface-->

<p>The primary purpose of user interfaces is to make the internals
of the model visible to the user, to control simulation execution,
and possibly allow the user to intervene by changing variables/objects
inside the model. This is very important in the development/debugging
phase of the simulation project. Equally important, a hands-on
experience allows the user to get a feel of the model's
behavior. The graphical user interface can also be used to
demonstrate a model's operation.

<p>
The same simulation model can be executed with various user
interfaces, with no change in the model files themselves.
The user would typically test and debug the simulation with a powerful
graphical user interface, and finally run it with a simple,
fast user interface that supports batch execution.

<p>
<p class="subheading">Component Libraries</p>
<!--module!libraries-->

<p>Module types can be stored in files separate from the place
of their actual use, enabling the user to group existing
module types and create component libraries.

<p>
<p class="subheading">Universal Standalone Simulation Programs</p>

<p>
A simulation executable can store several independent models
that use the same set of simple modules. The user can specify
in the configuration file which model is to be run. This
allows one to build one large executable that contains several
simulation models, and distribute it as a standalone simulation
tool. The flexibility of the topology description language also
supports this approach.
