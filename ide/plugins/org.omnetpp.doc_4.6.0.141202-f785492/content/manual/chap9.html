<a name="cha:config-sim"></a>

<p><h2><a name="sec330"/>9.1 The Configuration File</h2>

<p>Configuration and input data for the simulation are in
a configuration file usually called <tt>omnetpp.ini</tt>.

<p><h3><a name="sec331"/>9.1.1 An Example</h3>

<p>For a start, let us see a simple <tt>omnetpp.ini</tt> file which
can be used to run the Fifo example simulation.

<pre class="inifile">
[General]
network = FifoNet
sim-time-limit = 100h
cpu-time-limit = 300s
#debug-on-errors = true
#record-eventlog = true

[Config Fifo1]
description = "low job arrival rate"
**.gen.sendIaTime = exponential(0.2s)
**.gen.msgLength = 100b
**.fifo.bitsPerSec = 1000bps

[Config Fifo2]
description = "high job arrival rate"
**.gen.sendIaTime = exponential(0.01s)
**.gen.msgLength = 10b
**.fifo.bitsPerSec = 1000bps
</pre>
<p>
The file is grouped into <i>sections</i> named <tt>[General]</tt>, <tt>[Config Fifo1]</tt>
and <tt>[Config Fifo2]</tt>, each one containing several <i>entries</i>.

<p>
<h3><a name="sec332"/>9.1.2 File Syntax</h3>

<p>An OMNeT++ configuration file is an ASCII text file, but non-ASCII
characters are permitted in comments and string literals. This allows for
using encodings that are a superset of ASCII, for example ISO 8859-1 and
UTF-8. There is no limit on the file size or on the line length.

<p>Comments may be placed at the end of any line after a hash mark, &#8220;#&#8221;.
Comments extend to the end of the line, and are ignored during processing.
Blank lines are also allowed and ignored.

<p>The file is line oriented, and consists of <i>section heading lines</i>,
<i>key-value lines</i>, and <i>directive lines</i>:

<p><ol>
<li> <i>Section heading lines</i> contain a section name enclosed in square brackets.
<li> <i>Key-value lines</i> have the <i>&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</i> syntax; spaces
      are allowed (but not required) on both sides of the equal sign.
      If a line contains more than one equal sign, the leftmost one is taken
      as the key-value separator.
<li> Currently there is only one kind of directive line, <i>include</i>. An
      include line starts with the <tt>include</tt> word, followed by the name of
      the file to be included.
</ol>

<p>Key-value lines may not occur above the first section heading line (except
in included files, see later).

<p>Keys may be further classified based on syntax alone:

<p><ol>
<li> Keys that do not contain dots represent global or per-run <i>configuration options</i>.
<li> If a key contains a dot, its last component (substring after the last dot)
      is considered. If the last component contains a hyphen or is equal to
      <tt>typename</tt>, the key represents a <i>per-object configuration option</i>.
<li> Otherwise, the key represents a <i>parameter assignment</i>. Thus, parameter
      assignment keys contain a dot, and no hyphen after the last dot.
</ol>

<p>Long lines can be broken up using the backslash notation: if the last
character of a line is &#8220;\&#8221;, it will be merged with the next
line.

<p>An example:

<pre class="inifile">
# This is a comment line
[General]                       # section heading
network = Foo                   # configuration option
debug-on-errors = false         # another configuration option

**.vector-recording = false     # per-object configuration option
**.app*.typename = "HttpClient" # per-object configuration option

**.app*.interval = 3s           # parameter value
**.app*.requestURL = "http://www.example.com/this-is-a-very-very-very-very\
-very-long-url?q=123456789"     # a two-line parameter value
</pre>
<p>
<h3><a name="sec333"/>9.1.3 File Inclusion</h3>

<p>OMNeT++ supports including an ini file in another<!--ini file!file inclusion-->,
via the <tt>include</tt> keyword. This feature allows you to partition large ini
files into logical units, fixed and varying part, etc.

<p>An example:

<pre class="inifile">
# omnetpp.ini
...
include params1.ini
include params2.ini
include ../common/config.ini
...
</pre>
<p>
You can also include files from other directories. If the included ini file
further includes others, their path names will be understood as relative to
the location of the file which contains the reference, rather than relative
to the current working directory of the simulation.

<p>This rule also applies to other file names occurring in ini files (such as
the <b><tt>load-libs</tt></b>, <b><tt>output-vector-file</tt></b>,
<b><tt>output-scalar-file</tt></b>, etc. options, and <tt>xmldoc()</tt> module
parameter values.)

<p>In included files, it is allowed to have key-value lines without first having a
section heading line. File inclusion is conceptually handled as text
substitution, except that a section heading in an included file will not
change the current section the main file. The following example illustrates
the rules:

<pre class="inifile">
# incl.ini
foo1 = 1          # no preceding section heading: these lines will go into
foo2 = 2          # whichever section the file is included into
[Config Bar]
bar = 3           # this will always go to into [Config Bar]
</pre>
<p>
<pre class="inifile">
# omnetpp.ini
[General]
include incl.ini  # adds foo1/foo2 to [General], and defines [Config Bar] w/ bar
baz1 = 4          # include files don't change the current section, so these
baz2 = 4          # lines still belong to [General]
</pre>

<p><ul class="note"><b>NOTE</b><br>
The concept of file inclusion implies that include files may not make sense
on their own. Thus, when you open an included ini file in an specialized ini file
editor, the file contents may be flagged with errors and warnings. These
errors/warnings disappear when the file is viewed as part of its main file.
</ul>

<p>
<h2><a name="sec334"/>9.2 Sections</h2>
<a name="sec:ch-config-sim:general-section"></a>

<p>An ini file may contain a <tt>[General]</tt> section and several <tt>[Config &lt;configname&gt;]</tt>
sections. The order of the sections doesn't matter.

<p><h3><a name="sec335"/>9.2.1 The [General] Section</h3>

<p>The most commonly used options of the <tt>[General]</tt> section are the
following.

<p><ul>
  <li>The <b><tt>network</tt></b> option selects the model to be set up and run.
  <li>The length of the simulation can be set with the
    <b><tt>sim-time-limit</tt></b> and the <b><tt>cpu-time-limit</tt></b> options (the
    usual time units such as ms, s, m, h, etc. can be used).
</ul>

<p>Note that the NED files loaded by the simulation may contain several
networks, and any of them may be specified in the <b><tt>network</tt></b>
option.

<p>
<h3><a name="sec336"/>9.2.2 Named Configurations</h3>

<p>Named configurations are sections of the form <tt>[Config &lt;configname&gt;]</tt>, where
<i>&lt;configname&gt;</i> is by convention a camel-case string that starts with a capital letter:
<tt>Config1</tt>, <tt>WirelessPing</tt>, <tt>OverloadedFifo</tt>, etc. For example,
<tt>omnetpp.ini</tt> for an Aloha simulation might have the following skeleton:

<pre class="inifile">
[General]
...
[Config PureAloha]
...
[Config SlottedAloha1]
...
[Config SlottedAloha2]
...
</pre>
<p>
Some configuration options (such as user interface selection) are only
accepted in the <tt>[General]</tt> section, but most of them can go into <tt>Config</tt>
sections as well.

<p>When you run a simulation, you need to select one of the configurations
to be activated. In Cmdenv, this is done with the <tt>-c</tt> command-line option:

<pre class="commandline">
$ aloha -c PureAloha
</pre>
<p>
The simulation will then use the contents of the <tt>[Config PureAloha]</tt>
section to set up the simulation. (Tkenv, of course, lets you select
the configuration from a dialog.)

<p>
<h3><a name="sec337"/>9.2.3 Section Inheritance</h3>

<p>Actually, when you activate the PureAloha configuration, the contents of
the <tt>[General]</tt> section will also be taken into account: if some
configuration option or parameter value is not found in <tt>[Config PureAloha]</tt>,
then the search will continue in the <tt>[General]</tt> section. In
other words, lookups in <tt>[Config PureAloha]</tt> will fall back to <tt>[General]</tt>.
The <tt>[General]</tt> section itself is optional; when it is absent, it is
treated like an empty <tt>[General]</tt> section.

<p>All named configurations fall back to <tt>[General]</tt> by default. However, for
each configuration it is possible to specify the fall-back section or a list of
fallback sections explicitly, using the <b><tt>extends</tt></b> key. Consider the
following ini file skeleton:

<pre class="inifile">
[General]
...
[Config SlottedAlohaBase]
...
[Config LowTrafficSettings]
...
[Config HighTrafficSettings]
...

[Config SlottedAloha1]
extends = SlottedAlohaBase, LowTrafficSettings
...
[Config SlottedAloha2]
extends = SlottedAlohaBase, HighTrafficSettings
...
[Config SlottedAloha2a]
extends = SlottedAloha2
...
[Config SlottedAloha2b]
extends = SlottedAloha2
...
</pre>
<p>

<p>If you activate the <tt>SlottedAloha2b</tt> configuration, lookups will consider
sections in the following order (this is also called the
<i>section fallback chain</i>): <tt>SlottedAloha2b</tt>,
<tt>SlottedAloha2</tt>, <tt>SlottedAlohaBase</tt>, <tt>HighTrafficSettings</tt>,
<tt>General</tt>.

<p>The effect is the same as if the contents of the sections
SlottedAloha2b, SlottedAloha2, SlottedAlohaBase, HighTrafficSettings and
General were copied together into one section, one after another,
<tt>[Config SlottedAloha2b]</tt> being at the top, and <tt>[General]</tt>
at the bottom. Lookups always start at the top, and stop at the first
matching entry.

<p>The order of the sections in the <i>fallback chain</i> is computed
using the <i>C3 linearization algorithm</i> ([<a href="#bib-Barrett1996">Barrett1996</a>]):

<p>The <i>fallback chain</i> of a configuration <tt>A</tt> is
<ul>
  <li>if <tt>A</tt> does not have an <b><tt>extends</tt></b> key then
        <tt>A</tt>, <tt>General</tt>
  <li>otherwise the merge of the configurations enumerated in
        the <b><tt>extends</tt></b> key, and all of their
        <i>fallback section chains</i>.
        The merge is <i>monotonic</i>: if some configuration <tt>X</tt>
        precedes configuration <tt>Y</tt> in one of the input chains,
        it will precede it in the output chain too. 
</ul>

<p>The <i>section fallback chain</i> can be printed by the <tt>-X</tt> option
of the command line of the simulation program:

<pre class="commandline">
$ aloha -X SlottedAloha2b
`\opp` Discrete Event Simulation
...
Config SlottedAloha2b
Config SlottedAloha2
Config SlottedAlohaBase
Config HighTrafficSettings
General
</pre>
<p>
The <i>section fallback</i> concept is similar to multiple inheritance in
object-oriented languages, and benefits are similar too; you can factor out
the common parts of several configurations into a &#8220;base&#8221; configuration,
and additionally you can reuse existing configurations (as opposed to
copying them) by using them as a base. In practice you will often have
&#8220;abstract&#8221; configurations too (in the C++/Java sense), which assign only
a subset of parameters and leave the others open, to be assigned in derived
configurations.

<p>If you are experimenting a lot with different parameter settings of a
simulation model, these techniques will make it much easier to manage
ini files.

<p><h2><a name="sec338"/>9.3 Assigning Module Parameters</h2>
<a name="sec:ch-config-sim:parameter-settings"></a>

<p>Simulations get input via module parameters, which can be assigned a
value in NED files or in <tt>omnetpp.ini</tt> -- in this order. Since parameters
assigned in NED files cannot be overridden in <tt>omnetpp.ini</tt>, one can
think about them as being &#8220;hardcoded&#8221;. In contrast, it is easier
and more flexible to maintain module parameter settings in <tt>omnetpp.ini</tt>.

<p>In <tt>omnetpp.ini</tt>, module parameters are referred to by their full paths
(hierarchical names). This name consists of the dot-separated list of
the module names (from the top-level module down to the module containing
the parameter), plus the parameter name
(see section <a href="chap7.html#sec264">[7.1.5]</a>).

<p>An example <tt>omnetpp.ini</tt> which sets the <tt>numHosts</tt> parameter of
the toplevel module and the <tt>transactionsPerSecond</tt> parameter of the
<tt>server</tt> module:

<pre class="inifile">
[General]
Network.numHosts = 15
Network.server.transactionsPerSecond = 100
</pre>
<p>
Typename pattern assignments are also accepted:

<pre class="inifile">
[General]
Network.host[*].app.typename = "PingApp"
</pre>
<p>

<p><h3><a name="sec339"/>9.3.1 Using Wildcard Patterns</h3>
<a name="sec:ch-config-sim:wildcards"></a>

<p>Models can have a large number of parameters to be configured, and it would
be tedious to set them one-by-one in <tt>omnetpp.ini</tt>. OMNeT++ supports
<i>wildcard patterns</i> which allow for setting several model parameters
at once. The same pattern syntax is used for per-object configuration options;
for example <tt>&lt;object-path-pattern&gt;.record-scalar</tt>, or <tt>&lt;module-path-pattern&gt;.rng-&lt;N&gt;</tt>.

<p>The pattern syntax is a variation on Unix <i>glob</i>-style
patterns. The most apparent differences to globbing rules are the
distinction between <tt>*</tt> and <tt>**</tt>, and that character ranges should
be written with curly braces instead of square brackets; that is,
<i>any-letter</i> is expressed as <tt>{a-zA-Z}</tt> and not as
<tt>[a-zA-Z]</tt>, because square brackets are reserved for the notation of
module vector indices.

<p>Pattern syntax:

<p><ul>
  <li> <tt>?</tt> : matches any character except dot (.)
  <li> <tt>*</tt> : matches zero or more characters except dot (.)
  <li> <tt>**</tt> : matches zero or more characters (any character)
  <li> <tt>{a-f}</tt> : <i>set</i>: matches a character in the range a-f
  <li> <tt>{^a-f}</tt>: <i>negated set</i>: matches a character
    NOT in the range a-f
  <li> <tt>{38..150}</tt> : <i>numeric range</i>: any number (i.e. sequence of digits)
    in the range 38..150, inclusive; both limits are optional
  <li> <tt>[38..150]</tt> : <i>index range</i>: any number in square brackets in the
    range 38..150, inclusive; both limits are optional
  <li> backslash (\) : takes away the special meaning of the
    subsequent character
</ul>

<p><p class="subheading">Precedence</p>

<p>If you use wildcards, the order of entries is important; if a parameter
name matches several wildcard-patterns, the <i>first</i> matching occurrence
is used. This means that you need to list specific settings first, and
more general ones later. Catch-all settings should come last.

<p>An example ini file:

<pre class="inifile">
[General]
*.host[0].waitTime = 5ms   # specifics come first
*.host[3].waitTime = 6ms
*.host[*].waitTime = 10ms  # catch-all comes last
</pre>
<p>

<p><p class="subheading">Asterisk vs Double Asterisk</p>

<p>The <tt>*</tt> wildcard is for matching a single module or parameter name in the
path name, while <tt>**</tt> can be used to match several components in the path.
For example, <tt>**.queue*.bufSize</tt> matches the <tt>bufSize</tt> parameter of any module
whose name begins with <tt>queue</tt> in the model, while <tt>*.queue*.bufSize</tt>
or <tt>net.queue*.bufSize</tt> selects only queues immediately on network level.
Also note that <tt>**.queue**.bufSize</tt> would match <tt>net.queue1.foo.bar.bufSize</tt>
as well!

<p><p class="subheading">Sets, Negated Sets</p>

<p>Sets and negated sets can contain several character ranges and also
enumeration of characters. For example, <tt>{_a-zA-Z0-9}</tt> matches any letter
or digit, plus the underscore; <tt>{xyzc-f}</tt> matches any of the characters
x, y, z, c, d, e, f.
To include '-' in the set, put it at a position where it cannot be
interpreted as character range, for example: <tt>{a-z-}</tt> or <tt>{-a-z}</tt>.
If you want to include '}' in the set, it must be the first
character: <tt>{}a-z}</tt>, or as a negated set: <tt>{^}a-z}</tt>.
A backslash is always taken as a literal backslash (and not as an escape character)
within set definitions.

<p>
<p class="subheading">Numeric Ranges and Index Ranges</p>

<p>Only nonnegative integers can be matched.  The start or the end of the range
(or both) can be omitted: <tt>{10..}</tt>, <tt>{..99}</tt> or <tt>{..}</tt>
are valid numeric ranges (the last one matches any number).
The specification must use exactly two dots.
Caveat: <tt>*{17..19}</tt> will match <tt>a17</tt>, <tt>117</tt> and <tt>963217</tt> as well,
because the <tt>*</tt> can also match digits!

<p>An example for numeric ranges:

<pre class="inifile">
[General]
*.*.queue[3..5].bufSize = 10
*.*.queue[12..].bufSize = 18
*.*.queue[*].bufSize = 6  # this will only affect queues 0,1,2 and 6..11
</pre>
<p>

<p><h3><a name="sec340"/>9.3.2 Using the Default Values</h3>

<p>It is also possible to utilize the default values specified in the NED files.
The <i>&lt;parameter-fullpath&gt;</i><tt>=default</tt> setting assigns
the default value to a parameter if it has one.

<p>The <i>&lt;parameter-fullpath&gt;</i><tt>=ask</tt> setting will try to get the parameter
value interactively from the user.

<p>If a parameter was not set but has a default value, that value will be
assigned. This is like having a <tt>**=default</tt> line at the
bottom of the <tt>[General]</tt> section.

<p>If a parameter was not set and has no default value, that will either
cause an error or will be interactively prompted for, depending
on the particular user interface.

<p><ul class="note"><b>NOTE</b><br>
In Cmdenv you must explicitly enable the interactive mode with the
<tt>--cmdenv-interactive=true</tt> option otherwise you will get an error
when running the simulation.
</ul>

<p>More precisely, parameter resolution takes place as follows:

<p><ol>
<li> If the parameter is assigned in NED, it cannot be overridden in the
    configuration. The value is applied and the process finishes.
<li> If the first match is a value line (matches
    <i>&lt;parameter-fullpath&gt;</i><tt>=</tt><i>&lt;value&gt;</i>), the value is
    applied and the process finishes.
<li> If the first match is a <i>&lt;parameter-fullpath&gt;</i><tt>=default</tt> line,
    the default value is applied and the process finishes.
<li> If the first match is a <i>&lt;parameter-fullpath&gt;</i><tt>=ask</tt> line,
    the parameter will be asked from the user interactively (UI dependent).
<li> If there was no match and the parameter has a default value, it is applied
    and the process finishes.
<li> Otherwise the parameter is declared unassigned, and handled accordingly
    by the user interface. It may be reported as an error, or may be
    asked from the user interactively.
</ol>

<p>
<h2><a name="sec341"/>9.4 Parameter Studies</h2>

<p>It is quite common in simulation studies that the simulation model is
run several times with different parameter settings, and the results
are analyzed in relation to the input parameters. OMNeT++ 3.x had no
direct support for batch runs, and users had to resort to writing shell
(or Python, Ruby, etc.) scripts that iterated over the required
parameter space, to generate a (partial) ini file and run the
simulation program in each iteration.

<p>OMNeT++ 4.x largely automates this process, and eliminates the need for
writing batch execution scripts. It is the ini file where the user can
specify iterations over various parameter settings.
Here is an example:

<pre class="inifile">
[Config AlohaStudy]
*.numHosts = ${1, 2, 5, 10..50 step 10}
**.host[*].generationInterval = exponential(${0.2, 0.4, 0.6}s)
</pre>
<p>
This parameter study expands to 8*3 = 24 simulation runs, where the number of
hosts iterates over the numbers 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and for
each host count three simulation runs will be done, with the generation
interval being exponential(0.2), exponential(0.4), and
exponential(0.6).

<p>How does it work? First of all, Cmdenv with the <tt>-x</tt> option will tell you how many
simulation runs a given section expands to. (You will of course use Cmdenv for batch runs,
not Tkenv.)

<pre class="commandline">
$ aloha -u Cmdenv -x AlohaStudy

`\opp` Discrete Event Simulation
...
Config: AlohaStudy
Number of runs: 24
</pre>
<p>
If you add the <tt>-g</tt> option, the program will also print out the values
of the iteration variables for each run. (Use <tt>-G</tt> for even more info.)
Note that the parameter study actually maps to nested loops, with the last
<tt>${...}</tt> becoming the innermost loop. The iteration variables are
just named <tt>$0</tt> and <tt>$1</tt> -- we'll see that it is possible to give
meaningful names to them. Please ignore the <tt>$repetition=0</tt> part in
the printout for now.

<pre class="commandline">
$ aloha -u Cmdenv -x AlohaStudy -g
`\opp` Discrete Event Simulation
...
Config: AlohaStudy
Number of runs: 24
Run 0: $0=1, $1=0.2, $repetition=0
Run 1: $0=1, $1=0.4, $repetition=0
Run 2: $0=1, $1=0.6, $repetition=0
Run 3: $0=2, $1=0.2, $repetition=0
Run 4: $0=2, $1=0.4, $repetition=0
Run 5: $0=2, $1=0.6, $repetition=0
Run 6: $0=5, $1=0.2, $repetition=0
Run 7: $0=5, $1=0.4, $repetition=0
...
Run 19: $0=40, $1=0.4, $repetition=0
Run 20: $0=40, $1=0.6, $repetition=0
Run 21: $0=50, $1=0.2, $repetition=0
Run 22: $0=50, $1=0.4, $repetition=0
Run 23: $0=50, $1=0.6, $repetition=0
</pre>
<p>
Any of these runs can be executed by passing the <tt>-r &lt;runnumber&gt;</tt>
option to Cmdenv. So, the task is now to run the simulation program 24
times, with <tt>-r</tt> running from 0 through 23:

<pre class="commandline">
$ aloha -u Cmdenv -c AlohaStudy -r 0
$ aloha -u Cmdenv -c AlohaStudy -r 1
$ aloha -u Cmdenv -c AlohaStudy -r 2
...
$ aloha -u Cmdenv -c AlohaStudy -r 23
</pre>
<p>
This batch can be executed either from the OMNeT++ IDE (where you are
prompted to pick an executable and an ini file, choose the configuration
from a list, and just click Run), or using a little command-line
batch execution tool (<tt>opp_runall</tt>) supplied with OMNeT++.

<p>Actually, it is also possible to get Cmdenv execute all runs in one go,
by simply omitting the <tt>-r</tt> option.

<pre class="commandline">
$ aloha -u Cmdenv -c AlohaStudy

`\opp` Discrete Event Simulation
Preparing for running configuration AlohaStudy, run #0...
...
Preparing for running configuration AlohaStudy, run #1...
...
...
Preparing for running configuration AlohaStudy, run #23...
</pre>
<p>

<p>However, this approach is not recommended, because it is more
susceptible to C++ programming errors in the model. (For example, if
any of the runs crashes, the whole batch is terminated -- which may
not be what the user wants.)

<p>
<h3><a name="sec342"/>9.4.1 Iterations</h3>

<p>Let us have a look at the example ini file in the previous section again:

<pre class="inifile">
[Config AlohaStudy]
*.numHosts = ${1, 2, 5, 10..50 step 10}
**.host[*].generationInterval = exponential( ${0.2, 0.4, 0.6}s )
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>${...}</tt> syntax specifies an iteration. It is sort of a macro: at
each run, the whole <tt>${...}</tt> string is textually replaced with the
current iteration value. The values to iterate over do not need to be
numbers (unless you want to use the <i>"a..b"</i> or
<i>"a..b step c"</i> syntax), and the
substitution takes place even inside string constants. So, the
following examples are all valid (note that textual substitution is
used):

<p><pre class="verbatim">
*.param = 1 + ${1e-6, 1/3, sin(0.5)}
    ==&gt; *.param = 1 + 1e-6
        *.param = 1 + 1/3
        *.param = 1 + sin(0.5)
*.greeting = "We will simulate ${1,2,5} host(s)."
    ==&gt; *.greeting = "We will simulate 1 host(s)."
        *.greeting = "We will simulate 2 host(s)."
        *.greeting = "We will simulate 5 host(s)."
</pre>

<p>To write a literal <tt>${..}</tt> inside a string constant, quote
the left brace with a backslash: <tt>$\{..}</tt>.

<p><ul class="note"><b>NOTE</b><br>
Inside <tt>${..}</tt>, the values are separated with commas. However,
not every comma is taken as a value separator because the parser
tries to be smart about what you meant. Commas inside (nested) parentheses,
brackets or curly braces are ignored so that <tt>${uniform(0,3)}</tt> is
parsed as one value and not as <tt>uniform(0</tt> plus <tt>3)</tt>. Commas, curly
braces and other charachers inside double-quoted string literals are
also ignored, so <tt>${"Hello, world"}</tt> yields a single <tt>"Hello, world"</tt>
string and not <tt>"Hello</tt> plus <tt>world"</tt>. It is assumed that string literals
use backslash as an escape characher, like in C/C++ and NED.

<p>If you want to have a literal comma or close-brace inside a value, you need
to escape it with a backslash: <tt>${foo\,bar\}baz}</tt>
will parse as a single value, <tt>foo,bar}baz</tt>. Backslashes themselves must be doubled.
As the above examples illustrate, the parser removes one level of backslashes,
except inside string literals where they are left intact.
</ul>

<h3><a name="sec343"/>9.4.2 Named Iteration Variables</h3>

<p>You can assign names to iteration variables, which has the advantage
that you will see meaningful names instead of <tt>$0</tt> and
<tt>$1</tt> in the Cmdenv output, and also lets you refer to the variables at
more than one place in the ini file. The syntax is
<tt>${&lt;varname&gt;=&lt;iteration&gt;}</tt>, and variables can be referred to simply as
<tt>${&lt;varname&gt;}</tt>:

<pre class="inifile">
[Config Aloha]
*.numHosts = ${N=1, 2, 5, 10..50 step 10}
**.host[*].generationInterval = exponential( ${mean=0.2, 0.4, 0.6}s )
**.greeting = "There are ${N} hosts"
</pre>
<p>
The scope of the variable name is the section that defines it, plus
sections based on that section (via <b><tt>extends</tt></b>).

<p><p class="subheading">Referencing Other Iteration Variables</p>

<p>Iterations may refer to other iteration variables, using the dollar syntax
(<tt>$var</tt>) or the dollar-brace syntax (<tt>${var}</tt>).

<p>This feature makes it possible to have loops where the inner iteration range
depends on the outer one. An example:

<pre class="inifile">
**.foo = ${i=1..10}  # outer loop
**.bar = ${j=1..$i}  # inner loop depends on $i
</pre>
<p>
When needed, the default top-down nesting order of iteration loops is
modified (loops are reordered) to ensure that expressions only refer to
more outer loop variables, but not to inner ones. When this is not
possible, an error is generated with the &#8220;circular dependency&#8221; message.

<p>For instance, in the following example the loops will be nested in
<i>k - i - j</i> order, <i>k</i> being the outermost and <i>j</i>
the innermost loop:

<pre class="inifile">
**.foo = ${i=0..$k}   # must be inner to $k
**.bar = ${j=$i..$k}  # must be inner to both $i and $k
**.baz = ${k=1..10}   # may be the outermost loop
</pre>
<p>
And the next example will stop with an error because there is no &#8220;good&#8221;
ordering:

<pre class="inifile">
**.foo = ${i=0..$j}
**.bar = ${j=0..$k}
**.baz = ${k=0..$i} # --&gt; error: circular references
</pre>
<p>
Variables are substituted <i>textually</i>, and the result is normally
<i>not</i> evaluated as an arithmetic expression.  The result of the
substitution is only evaluated where needed, namely in the three arguments
of iteration ranges (<i>from</i>, <i>to</i>, <i>step</i>), and in the
value of the <b><tt>constraint</tt></b> configuration option.

<p>To illustrate textual substitution, consider the following contorted example:

<pre class="inifile">
**.foo = ${i=1..3, 1s+, -}001s
</pre>
<p>
Here, the <tt>foo</tt> NED parameter will receiving the following values in subsequent runs:
<tt>1001s</tt>, <tt>2001s</tt>, <tt>3001s</tt>, <tt>1s+001s</tt>, <tt>-001s</tt>.

<p><ul class="caution"><b>CAUTION</b><br>
Due to textual substitution, variables in arithmetic expressions should be
protected with parentheses -- just like in C/C++ function-style macros.
Consider the following example:

<pre class="inifile">
**.foo = ${i=10}
**.bar = ${j=$i+5}
**.baz = ${k=2*$j}   # bogus! $j should be written as ($j)
constraint = $i+50 &lt; 2*$j  # ditto: should use ($i) and ($j)
</pre>
<p>
Here, the <tt>baz</tt> parameter will receive the string <tt>2*10+5</tt> after
the substitutions and hence evaluate to <i>25</i> instead of the correct
<i>2*(10+5)=30</i>; the constraint expression is similarly wrong. Mind the parens!
</ul>

<p>Substitution also works inside string constants within iterations (<tt>${..}</tt>).

<pre class="inifile">
**.foo = "${i=Jo}"  # -&gt; Jo
**.bar = ${"Hi $i", "Hi ${i}hn"}  # -&gt; Hi Jo /John
</pre>
<p>
However, outside iterations the plain dollar syntax is not understood, only
the dollar-brace syntax is:

<pre class="inifile">
**.foo = "${i=Day}"
**.baz = "Good $i"     # -&gt; remains "Good $i"
**.baz = "Good ${i}"   # -&gt; becomes "Good Day"
</pre>
<p>
<ul class="rationale"><b>Rationale</b><br>
The text substitution model was chosen for greater flexibility as well as
the ability to produce more consistent semantics. The advantages outweigh
the inconvenience of having to parenthesize variable references in
arithmetic expressions.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><a name="sec344"/>9.4.3 Parallel Iteration</h3>

<p>The body of an iteration may end in an exclamation mark followed by the
name of another iteration variable. This syntax denotes a <i>parallel
iteration</i>. A parallel iteration does not define a loop of its own, but
rather, the sequence is advanced in lockstep with the variable after the
&#8220;!&#8221;. In other words, the &#8220;!&#8221; syntax chooses the <i>kth</i> value from
the iteration, where <i>k</i> is the position (iteration count) of the
iteration variable after the &#8220;!&#8221;.

<p>An example:

<pre class="inifile">
**.plan =     ${plan= "A", "B", "C", "D"}
**.numHosts = ${hosts= 10,  20,  50, 100 ! plan}
**.load =     ${load= 0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.4 ! plan}
</pre>
<p>
In the above example, the only loop is defined by the first line, the <tt>plan</tt>
variable. The other two iterations, <tt>hosts</tt> and <tt>load</tt> just follow it;
for the first value of <tt>plan</tt> the first values of <tt>host</tt> and <tt>load</tt>
are selected, and so on.

<p>

<p><h3><a name="sec345"/>9.4.4 Predefined Variables, Run ID</h3>

<p>There are a number of predefined variables: <tt>${configname}</tt> and
<tt>${runnumber}</tt> with the obvious meanings; <tt>${network}</tt> is the
name of the network that is simulated; <tt>${processid}</tt> and
<tt>${datetime}</tt> expand to the OS process id of the simulation and the
time it was started; and there are some more: <tt>${runid},</tt>
<tt>${iterationvars}</tt> and <tt>${repetition}.</tt>

<p><tt>${runid}</tt> holds the <i>run ID</i>. When a simulation is run, a a
run ID is generated that uniquely identifies that instance of the
simulation: if you run the same thing again, it will get a different run
ID. Run ID is a concatenation of several variables like
<tt>${configname},</tt> <tt>${runnumber},</tt> <tt>${datetime}</tt> and
<tt>${processid}.</tt> This yields an identifier that is unique &#8220;enough&#8221;
for all practical purposes, yet it is meaningful for humans. The run ID is
recorded into result files written during the simulation, and can be used
to match vectors and scalars written by the same simulation run.

<p>
<h3><a name="sec346"/>9.4.5 Constraint Expression</h3>

<p>In cases when not all combinations of the iteration variables make sense
or need to be simulated, it is possible to specify an additional
constraint expression. This expression is interpreted as a conditional
(an "if" statement) within the innermost
loop, and it must evaluate to <tt>true</tt> for
the variable combination to generate a run. The expression should be
given with the <b><tt>constraint</tt></b> configuration option. An example:

<pre class="inifile">
*.numNodes = ${n=10..100 step 10}
**.numNeighbors = ${m=2..10 step 2}
constraint = ($m) &lt;= sqrt($n)  # note: parens needed due to textual substitution
</pre>
<p>
The expression syntax supports most C language operators including boolean,
conditional and binary shift operations, and most <tt>&lt;math.h&gt;</tt> functions;
data types are boolean, double and string. The expression must evaluate to
a boolean.

<p><ul class="note"><b>NOTE</b><br>
Remember that variables are substituted textually into the expresssion, so
they must be protected with parentheses to preserve evaluation order.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><a name="sec347"/>9.4.6 Repeating Runs with Different Seeds</h3>

<p>It is directly supported to perform several runs with the same
parameters but different random number seeds. There are two
configuration options related to this: <b><tt>repeat</tt></b> and <b><tt>seed-set</tt></b>.
The first one simply specifies how many times a run needs to be repeated. For
example,

<pre class="inifile">
repeat = 10
</pre>
<p>
causes every combination of iteration variables to be repeated 10 times,
and the <tt>${repetition}</tt> predefined variable holds the loop counter.
Indeed, <tt>repeat=10</tt> is equivalent to adding <tt>${repetition=0..9}</tt>
to the ini file. The <tt>${repetition}</tt> loop always becomes the innermost loop.

<p>The <b><tt>seed-set</tt></b> configuration key affects seed selection. Every
simulation uses one or more random number generators (as configured by
the <b><tt>num-rngs</tt></b> key), for which the simulation kernel can automatically
generate seeds. The first simulation run may use one set of seeds (seed
set 0), the second run may use a second set (seed set 1), and so on.
Each set contains as many seeds as there are RNGs configured. All
automatic seeds generate random number sequences that are far apart in
the RNG's cycle, so they will never overlap during
simulations.

<p><ul class="note"><b>NOTE</b><br>
Mersenne Twister, the default RNG of OMNeT++ has a cycle length of
<i>2<sup>19937</sup></i>, which is more than enough for any conceivable purpose.
</ul>

<p>The <b><tt>seed-set</tt></b> key tells the simulation kernel which seed set to use.
It can be set to a concrete number (such as <tt>seed-set=0</tt>), but it
usually does not make sense as it would cause every simulation to run
with exactly the same seeds. It is more practical to set it to either
<tt>${runnumber}</tt> or to <tt>${repetition}</tt>. The default setting is
<tt>${runnumber}</tt>:

<pre class="inifile">
seed-set = ${runnumber}   # this is the default
</pre>
<p>
This causes every simulation run to execute with a unique seed set. The
second option is:

<pre class="inifile">
seed-set = ${repetition}
</pre>
<p>
where all <tt>$repetition=0</tt> runs will use the same seeds (seed set 0), all
<tt>$repetition=1</tt> runs use another seed set, <tt>$repetition=2</tt> a third seed
set, etc.

<p>To perform runs with manually selected seed sets, you can just define an
iteration for the <b><tt>seed-set</tt></b> key:

<pre class="inifile">
seed-set = ${5,6,8..11}
</pre>
<p>
In this case, the <b><tt>repeat</tt></b> key should be left out, as <b><tt>seed-set</tt></b>
already defines an iteration and there is no need for an extra loop.

<p>It is of course also possible to manually specify individual seeds for
simulations. The parallel iteration feature is very convenient here:

<pre class="inifile">
repeat = 4
seed-1-mt = ${53542, 45732, 47853, 33434 ! repetition}
seed-2-mt = ${75335, 35463, 24674, 56673 ! repetition}
seed-3-mt = ${34542, 67563, 96433, 23567 ! repetition}
</pre>
<p>
The meaning of the above is this: in the first repetition, the first
column of seeds is chosen, for the second repetition, the second
column, etc. The "!" syntax chooses the
<i>kth</i> value from the iteration, where <i>k</i> is the position
(iteration count) of the iteration variable after the
"!". Thus, the above example is equivalent to the following:

<pre class="inifile">
# no repeat= line!
seed-1-mt = ${seed1 = 53542, 45732, 47853, 33434}
seed-2-mt = ${        75335, 35463, 24674, 56673 ! seed1}
seed-3-mt = ${        34542, 67563, 96433, 23567 ! seed1}
</pre>
<p>
That is, the iterators of <tt>seed-2-mt</tt> and <tt>seed-3-mt</tt> are advanced
in lockstep with the <tt>seed1</tt> iteration.

<p>

<p><h3><a name="sec348"/>9.4.7 Experiment-Measurement-Replication</h3>

<p>We have introduced three concepts that are useful for organizing
simulation results generated by batch executions or several batches of
executions.

<p>During a simulation study, a user prepares several
<i>experiments</i>. The purpose of an experiment is to find out the
answer to questions like <i>"how does the number of
nodes affect response times in the network?"</i> For an
experiment, several <i>measurements</i> are performed on the
simulation model, and each measurement runs the simulation model with a
different set of parameters. To eliminate the bias introduced by the
particular random number stream used for the simulation, several
<i>replications</i> of every measurement are run with different
random number seeds, and the results are averaged.

<p>OMNeT++ result analysis tools can take advantage of the <i>experiment</i>,
<i>measurement</i> and <i>replication</i> labels recorded into result
files, and display simulation runs and recorded results accordingly on
the user interface.

<p>These labels can be explicitly specified in the ini file using the
<b><tt>experiment-label</tt></b>, <b><tt>measurement-label</tt></b> and <b><tt>replication-label</tt></b>
config options. If they are missing, the default is the following:

<pre class="inifile">
experiment-label = "${configname}"
measurement-label = "${iterationvars}"
replication-label = "#${repetition},seed-set=&lt;seedset&gt;"
</pre>
<p>
That is, the default experiment label is the configuration name; the
measurement label is concatenated from the iteration variables; and the
replication label contains the repeat loop variable and seed-set.
Thus, for our first example the <i>experiment-measurement-replication</i>
tree would look like this:

<p><pre class="verbatim">
"PureAloha"<i><i>--experiment</i></i>
  $N=1,$mean=0.2<i><i> -- measurement</i></i>
    #0, seed-set=0<i><i> -- replication</i></i>
    #1, seed-set=1
    #2, seed-set=2
    #3, seed-set=3
    #4, seed-set=4
  $N=1,$mean=0.4
    #0, seed-set=5
    #1, seed-set=6
    ...
    #4, seed-set=9
  $N=1,$mean=0.6
    #0, seed-set=10
    #1, seed-set=11
    ...
    #4, seed-set=14
  $N=2,$mean=0.2
    ...
  $N=2,$mean=0.4
    ...
    ...
</pre>

<p>The <i>experiment-measurement-replication</i> labels should be enough to
reproduce the same simulation results, given of course that the ini
files and the model (NED files and C++ code) haven't changed.

<p>Every instance of running the simulation gets a unique run ID. We can
illustrate this by listing the corresponding run IDs under each
repetition in the tree. For example:

<p><pre class="verbatim">
"PureAloha"
  $N=1,$mean=0.2
    #0, seed-set=0
      <i>PureAloha-0-20070704-11:38:21-3241</i>
      <i>PureAloha-0-20070704-11:53:47-3884</i>
      <i>PureAloha-0-20070704-16:50:44-4612</i>
    #1, seed-set=1
      <i>PureAloha-1-20070704-16:50:55-4613</i>
    #2, seed-set=2
      <i>PureAloha-2-20070704-11:55:23-3892</i>
      <i>PureAloha-2-20070704-16:51:17-4615</i>
      ...
</pre>

<p>The tree shows that ("PureAloha", "$N=1,$mean=0.2", "#0, seed-set=0")
was run three times. The results produced
by these three executions should be identical, unless, for example,
some parameter was modified in the ini file, or a bug got fixed in the
C++ code.

<p>We believe that the default way of generating
<i>experiment-measurement-replication</i> labels is useful and
sufficient for the majority of simulation studies. However, you can
customize it if needed. For example, here is a way to join two
configurations into one experiment:

<pre class="inifile">
[Config PureAloha_Part1]
experiment-label = "PureAloha"
...
[Config PureAloha_Part2]
experiment-label = "PureAloha"
...
</pre>
<p>
Measurement and replication labels can be customized in a similar way,
making use of named iteration variables, <tt>${repetition}</tt>,
<tt>${runnumber}</tt> and other predefined variables. One possible benefit is
to customize the generated measurement and replication labels. For
example:

<pre class="inifile">
[Config PureAloha_Part1]
measurement = "${N} hosts, exponential(${mean}) packet generation interval"
</pre>
<p>
One should be careful with the above technique though, because if some
iteration variables are left out of the measurement labels, runs with
all values of those variables will be grouped together to the same
replications.

<p>
<h2><a name="sec349"/>9.5 Configuring the Random Number Generators</h2>
<a name="sec:ch-config-sim:rng-config"></a>

<p>The random number architecture of OMNeT++ was already outlined
in section <a href="chap7.html#sec270">[7.4]</a>. Here
we'll cover the configuration of RNGs in <tt>omnetpp.ini</tt>.

<p><h3><a name="sec350"/>9.5.1 Number of RNGs</h3>

<p>The <b><tt>num-rngs</tt></b> configuration option sets the number of
random number generator instances (i.e. random number streams)
available for the simulation model (see <a href="chap7.html#sec270">[7.4]</a>).
Referencing an RNG number greater or equal to this number
(from a simple module or NED file) will cause a runtime error.

<p>
<h3><a name="sec351"/>9.5.2 RNG Choice</h3>

<p>The <b><tt>rng-class</tt></b> configuration option sets the random number
generator class to be used. It defaults to <tt>"<a href="../api/classcMersenneTwister.html">cMersenneTwister</a>"</tt>,
the Mersenne Twister RNG. Other available classes are <tt>"<a href="../api/classcLCG32.html">cLCG32</a>"</tt>
(the "legacy" RNG of OMNeT++ 2.3 and earlier versions, with a cycle length
of <i>2<sup>31</sup>-2</i>), and <tt>"cAkaroaRNG"</tt> (Akaroa's random number generator,
see section <a href="chap10.html#sec371">[10.5]</a>).

<p><h3><a name="sec352"/>9.5.3 RNG Mapping</h3>

<p>The RNG numbers used in simple modules may be arbitrarily mapped to the
actual random number streams (actual RNG instances) from <tt>omnetpp.ini</tt>.
The mapping allows for great flexibility in RNG usage and random number
streams configuration -- even for simulation models which were not
written with RNG awareness.

<p>RNG mapping may be specified in <tt>omnetpp.ini</tt>. The syntax of
configuration entries is the following.

<pre class="inifile">
[General]
&lt;modulepath&gt;.rng-N = M  # where N,M are numeric, M &lt; num-rngs
</pre>
<p>
This maps module-local RNG N to physical RNG M. The following
example maps all <tt>gen</tt> module's default (N=0) RNG to physical RNG 1,
and all <tt>noisychannel</tt> module's default (N=0) RNG to physical RNG 2.

<pre class="inifile">
[General]
num-rngs = 3
**.gen[*].rng-0 = 1
**.noisychannel[*].rng-0 = 2
</pre>
<p>
This mapping allows variance reduction techniques to be applied to
OMNeT++ models, without any model change or recompilation.

<p>
<h3><a name="sec353"/>9.5.4 Automatic Seed Selection</h3>

<p>Automatic seed selection is used for an RNG if you do not explicitly
specify seeds in <tt>omnetpp.ini</tt>. Automatic and manual seed selection can
co-exist; for a particular simulation, some RNGs can be configured
manually, and some automatically.

<p>The automatic seed selection mechanism uses two inputs: the <i>run number</i>
 and the <i>RNG number</i>. For the same run number and RNG number,
OMNeT++ always selects the same seed value for any simulation model.
If the run number or the RNG number is different, OMNeT++ does its best
to choose different seeds which are also sufficiently separated in the RNG's sequence
so that the generated sequences don't overlap.

<p>The run number can be specified either in in <tt>omnetpp.ini</tt> (e.g. via the
<b><tt>cmdenv-runs-to-execute</tt></b> option) or on the command line:

<pre class="commandline">
./mysim -r 1
./mysim -r 2
./mysim -r 3
</pre>
<p>
For the <tt><a href="../api/classcMersenneTwister.html">cMersenneTwister</a></tt> random number generator, selecting seeds
so that the generated sequences don't overlap is easy,
due to the extremely long sequence of the RNG.
The RNG is initialized from the 32-bit seed value <i>seed = runNumber*numRngs + rngNumber</i>.
(This implies that simulation runs participating in the study should have
the same number of RNGs set).
    <br><ul><font size=-1>[While (to our knowledge) no one has proven that the seeds 0,1,2,...
    are well apart in the sequence, this is probably true, due to the extremely
    long sequence of MT. The author would however be interested in papers
    published about seed selection for MT.]</font></ul>

<p>For the <tt><a href="../api/classcLCG32.html">cLCG32</a></tt> random number generator, the situation is more difficult,
because the range of this RNG is rather short (<i>2<sup>31</sup>-1</i>, about 2 billion).
For this RNG, OMNeT++ uses a table of 256 pre-generated seeds, equally spaced
in the RNG's sequence. Index into the table is calculated with the
<i>runNumber*numRngs + rngNumber</i> formula. Care should be taken that
one doesn't exceed 256 with the index, or it will wrap and the
same seeds will be used again. It is best not to use the <tt><a href="../api/classcLCG32.html">cLCG32</a></tt>
at all -- <tt><a href="../api/classcMersenneTwister.html">cMersenneTwister</a></tt> is superior in every respect.

<p>
<h3><a name="sec354"/>9.5.5 Manual Seed Configuration</h3>

<p>In some cases you may want to manually configure seed values.
Reasons for doing that may be that you want to use variance reduction
techniques, or you may want to use the same seeds for several simulation
runs.

<p>To manually set seeds for the Mersenne Twister RNG, use the <tt>seed-</tt><i>k</i><tt>-mt</tt>
option, where <i>k</i> is the RNG index. An example:

<pre class="inifile">
[General]
num-rngs = 3
seed-0-mt = 12
seed-1-mt = 9
seed-2-mt = 7
</pre>
<p>
<a name="sec:ch-config-sim:seedtool"></a>

<p>For the now obsolete <a href="../api/classcLCG32.html">cLCG32</a> RNG, the name of the corresponding option is
<tt>seed-</tt><i>k</i><tt>-lcg32</tt>, and OMNeT++ provides a standalone program
called <tt>opp_lcg32_seedtool</tt> to generate good seed values that
are sufficiently separated in the RNG's sequence.
