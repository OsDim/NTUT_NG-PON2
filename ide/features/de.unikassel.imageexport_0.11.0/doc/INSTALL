Basic Setup
-----------

When downloading the Image Export Plug In, you get a file called

de.unikassel.imageexport_x.y.z.zip

This archive contains an eclipse directory with the two subdirectories
plugins and features.  Copy the contents of these two directories
into the plugins and features directories, respectively, in your
Eclipse installation directory.

Also copy the logging plug in to the plugins directory of your
Eclipse installation directory.

Now, the basic export formats (PNG, JPEG, BMP) should be available.
After restarting Eclipse, you should see the Image Export feature and
plug ins under Help > About Eclipse SDK > Feature Details / Plugin
Details.


Additional Formats
------------------

There are plug ins for other formats available as well.  There are
plug ins for EPS, PDF and SVG, each depending on other plug ins that
you have to install, too.

EPS, PDF and SVG all depend on the GMF plug in (Graphical Modeling
Framework). You can install this by selecting "Help > Software
Updates > Find and Install...", and choose to install "new features"
from the "Ganymede Update Site".  GMF has a lot of dependencies of
its own so "Select Required" often comes in handy.

The EPS plug in depends on Apache XML Graphics Commons.  This is
provided as a download, too.

The PDF plug in depends on iText which you can install like GMF, have
a look at the section called "Enabling Features".

The SVG plug in depends on Batik which you can install like GMF, have
a look at the section called "Enabling Features".
