JSimpleModule
=============

This is an extension that makes it possible to write OMNeT++ simple modules
in Java.

You'll need to install JDT (=Java development support) into the OMNeT++ IDE,
which can be done via Help|Software Updates|Find and install... in the menu,
from the "Eclipse Project Updates" update site.

The jsimple and jsamples directories are Eclipse projects that can be imported
into the IDE.

Further details in jsimple/README -- read it before you start programming!

Enjoy,
Andras
