echo NED files has been converted.
echo.
echo Since there were semantic changes in the NED language, there are details
echo that could not be converted automatically. Please revise the following:
echo.
echo  1. Adjust "import" directives. Previously they pointed to files, now
echo     they refer to module types.
echo.
echo  2. Remove "volatile" qualifiers from parameters that are only read
echo     from the C++ code once, at the beginning of the simulation.
echo.
echo  3. Old "numeric" parameters have been converted to "double", but
echo     you may want to change some of those to "int".
echo.
echo  4. Remove unnecessary networks definitions. Compound modules can now be
echo     used as networks directly, by changing the "module" keyword to
echo     "network".
echo.
echo  5. Additionally, you can change the files to take advantage of new NED
echo     features: module default icons, parameter physical units, inout gates
echo     and bidirectional connections, inheritance, inner types, and so on.
echo.
echo You may safely re-run this script any time you want.
